XTP1 NIP LIGHTNING EDITION
"It is no coincidence that the XTP1 mousepad is used by many professional gamers. The advanced weaving structure of the surface provides great glide and super-precise tracking for both laser and optical mice. And the natural rubber base keeps the pad perfectly still during the most intense moments of gaming.

COMFORT

The material composition not only enhances performance, it also makes the XTP1 an exceptionally comfortable mousepad. If you want your swipes and flicks to feel smooth and soft, this is the pad to lay your hands on.

ROOM FOR BIG MOVES

The Large version of the XTP1 provides plenty of room for both high and low mouse sensitivity.

For convenience, all of Xtrfy's XTP1 and XGP1 mousepads are machine washable. 30°C, no tumbling, no ironing – and your pad will look as good as new.
